# About me
I am a|an
 - Software writer/debugger
 - 3d, raster, and vector artist
 - web frontend, backend, and UI dev
 - amature guitarist, pianist, audio engineer, vocalist, and photographer
 - Problem solver


I rent a web server and linux virtual server, and use both
to handle running my projects and services, such as the site
you may be viewing this content on.


I fix the majority of my own hardware at home, and have repaired
computers for cash (not as cool as code)


I wrote this site from absolute scratch, and use [showdown.js](http://www.showdownjs.com/)
to render markdown formatted content pages (such as this one).


I enjoy math, and my life goal is to teach otherwise complicated math
by using code instead of paper to a young audience.
